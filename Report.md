## 2. _due 10/25_ Project topic
Our project topic is going to be sorting algorithms. We'll work on implementing several common sorting algorithms using MPI and Cuda.

## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)
